Some [UN OCHA](https://www.unocha.org/) activities are encapsulated in this tool with respect to Common Operational Datasets maintenance. Find metadata and location information and gazeteer type output for the CODs compatible for applications and for visualizations. The scope of the data varies but comprises enhanced CODs processed in OCHA workflows for roughly 50 countries (as shown in the [COD dashboard](https://cod.unocha.org/)) in the humanitarian support sphere. For more information see the [About page](https://beta.itos.uga.edu/CODV2API/Home/About). Enjoy and comments welcome at ocha-fis-data@un.org.  ## What are CODs? Common Operational Datasets (CODs) are authoritative reference datasets needed to support operations and decision-making for all actors in a humanitarian response. CODs are 'best available' datasets that ensure consistency and simplify the discovery and exchange of key data for the humanitarian community.
